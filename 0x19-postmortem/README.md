<h1>Postmortem: Apache 500 Error Resolution and Automation</h1>

<b>Issue Summary</b>:
During the period of August 8, 2023, an Apache server experienced repeated 500 Internal Server Errors. The error resulted in degraded service availability, causing inconvenience to users and impacting their experience.

Timeline:

August 8, 2023, 10:00 (UTC): Reports of 500 errors received from users accessing the Apache server.<br>
August 8, 2023, 10:15 (UTC): Initial investigation began by analyzing Apache error logs to identify the root cause.<br>
August 8, 2023, 10:45 (UTC): No specific errors found in the logs. Decided to use strace to trace system calls of the Apache process.<br>
August 8, 2023, 11:00 (UTC): strace attached to the Apache process to monitor system calls.<br>
August 8, 2023, 11:15 (UTC): Observed repeated attempts to access a specific shared library file that was missing.<br>
August 8, 2023, 11:30 (UTC): Determined that the missing shared library file was causing the 500 errors by analyzing the strace output.<br>
August 8, 2023, 12:00 (UTC): Manually restored the missing shared library file to the appropriate location to confirm resolution.<br>
August 8, 2023, 13:00 (UTC): Conducted thorough testing to ensure the Apache server was functioning without errors.<br>
<b>`Root Cause and Resolution:y</b>
Root Cause: The Apache server was unable to access a required shared library file, leading to the 500 Internal Server Errors. This occurred due to the file being accidentally deleted during a recent system maintenance.

<b>Resolutiony</b>: The missing shared library file was identified and manually restored to its original location. The Apache server started functioning correctly after the file was restored, and the 500 errors were no longer present.

<b>Automation Using Puppet:y</b>
To automate the resolution process and prevent similar incidents in the future, we have created a Puppet manifest file 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp:

Corrective and Preventative Measures: Improvements/Fixes:
Automated Deployment: Implement automated deployment pipelines to ensure consistent server configurations and avoid accidental file deletions.
Backup and Recovery: Enhance backup and recovery procedures to quickly restore critical files in case of accidental deletions.
Monitoring and Alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies in Apache server behavior and response times.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Audit Shared Libraries: Conduct a thorough audit of shared libraries and critical files on all servers to identify any discrepancies or missing files.
Update Documentation: Update documentation to include best practices for system maintenance and the use of tools like strace for debugging.
Puppet Automation: Implement Puppet manifests to automate critical tasks like library file management and service restarts.
Training: Train operations teams in using strace and other debugging tools to quickly identify and resolve issues.<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br> The Apache 500 Internal Server Errors were traced back to a missing shared library file, which was restored manually to resolve the issue. By creating a Puppet manifest to automate the restoration process and implementing best practices for system maintenance, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and maintain the stability and reliability of our se
